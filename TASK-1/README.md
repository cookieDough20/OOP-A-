Data Types
-------------
Q1: Write a Java program to declare variables of all primitive data types. Initialize them with valid values and print their sizes using appropriate wrappers.

Q2: Accept a student’s details like name, roll number, age, gender, and percentage. Display them using formatted output.

Type Conversion (Widening & Narrowing)
----------------------------------------
Q3: Write a program to demonstrate widening type conversion from int → long → float. Show that no data is lost.

Q4: Write a program to demonstrate narrowing type conversion from double to int. Accept a double input and cast it to int. Print both values.

Q5: Accept a character from the user and display its ASCII value. Also convert that ASCII value into an integer.

Operator Precedence
--------------------
Q6: Evaluate and print the result of the following expressions:

10 + 2 * 5

(10 + 2) * 5

100 / 5 + 2 * 3 - 4

Q7: Accept three numbers and calculate the average using a single expression. Analyze how precedence affects the result.

 Arithmetic, Logical and Bitwise Operators
------------------------------------------
Q8: Accept two numbers and perform all arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) and print the results.

Q9: Accept two integers and apply all bitwise operations (&, |, ^, <<, >>), then display the results in both binary and decimal formats.

Q10: Write a program to check if a number is divisible by 3 AND 5 using logical operators.

Final Keyword
-------------------------------
Q11: Write a program using final keyword to define a constant PI = 3.14159 and use it to calculate the area and circumference of a circle. Take radius as input.

Q12: Declare a final variable and try modifying it (intentionally). Observe and explain the compile-time error.

Static variables, Static block and Static mathods:
---------------------------------------------------
Q13. Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of static keyword in the context of a student management system,
which includes: A static variable to represent the college name shared by all students,A static block to initialize the static variable.
A static method to change the college name and an Instance variables to store student ID and name.

A method to display student details, including the shared college name.
Q14.Write a Java program to demonstrate a Scenario of banking system, use static keyword through the scenario.
Static variables – to represent values shared among all objects,A static block – to initialize static data when the class is loaded,
Static methods – to operate on static data,Use Instance variables and methods – to represent object-specific data.

this Keyword
-----------------
Q15.Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of this keyword with variables and this() for constructor chaining.
Create a Student class with id, name, and course.Use this() to call a parameterized constructor from the default constructor.
Use this.variable to differentiate instance variables.Display student details using a method. Create two objects (one with default and one with parameterized constructor) and display their details.

Super Keyword
---------------
Q16. Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of super keyword, Create a Person class with a constructor and a method.
Create a Student class that extends Person class, now Use super() to call the parent class constructor (Use super.method())then Display student details including inherited data.
